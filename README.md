Minimal data on Icelandic landnúmer.

A landnúmer is a unique identifer for each plot of land containing a building;
every building in the country has one of these ids. They're maintained by
Þjóðskrá, the National Registry of Iceland.

This file is a version of the Staðfangaskrá (address registry) provided by
Þjóðskrá, whittled down to a bare minimum. Each record contains a landnúmer, its
post code and longitude and latitude.

The source is [available from the Icelandic government's open data portal] [1],
and is released under an (unspecified) open data licence.
