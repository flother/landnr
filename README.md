Records for each and every building in Iceland.

Each record contains a landnúmer and a building id (more on these below), a
street address, a post code, and a longitude and latitude. The longitude and
latitude denote the centre point of the building.

A landnúmer is a unique identifer for each plot of land containing one or more
buildings; every such plot in the country has one of these ids. They're
maintained by Þjóðskrá, the National Registry of Iceland.

Each building in the country should in theory be uniquely identifiable by a its
street address and landnúmer, although in practice this isn't true because the
data isn't accurate enough. Hence the building id, also provider by Þjóðskrá,
which does uniquely identify a building.

This file is a version of the Staðfangaskrá (address registry) provided by
Þjóðskrá, whittled down to a useful minimum.
